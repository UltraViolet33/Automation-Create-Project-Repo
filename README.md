# Create-Project-Automation

## Description
This is a litte Python-Bash-Powershell project so you no more need to do it yourself

This project automates the project creation 
    - creates the folder in the directory you indicates
    - creates the files you indicates
    - initialize git 
    - and open the project with your IDE
    - It can also create the repository in your github account 

I used bash and powershell scripts to practice this langages
I also used Python with Selenium for web scraping 

## Scripts
There are two scripts, one bash and one powershell. They do the same thing


## Python Script
This script do the same thing as the scripts of scripts folder but also uses Selenium with Python
to create a repository in your github account
It does not work all the time because Github can use double auth when when Python log in
